# jloda-phylogeny

This package provides algorithms for phylogenetics using function interfaces for easy deployment in other tools.

Presently this provides

- a displacement-optimization algorithm for backbone-tree based layout of rooted phylogenetic networks. If you use it, please cite Daniel H. Huson, Sketch, Capture and Layout Phylogenies, under review.


- a displacement-optimization algorithm for a tanglegram between rooted phylogenetic trees and/or networks. If you use this code, then please cite: Daniel H. Huson, Tanglegrams for trees and networks optimizing reticulate displacement and taxon displacement.
