# jloda-phylogeny

This package provides algorithms for phylogenetics using function interfaces for easy deployment in other tools.

Presently this provides

- a displacement-optimization algorithm for backbone-tree based layout of rooted phylogenetic networks
- a displacement-optimization algorithm for a tanglegram between rooted phylogenetic trees and/or networks
